# Abstract

In the dynamic retail landscape, accurate sales forecasting is essential for effective inventory management, demand planning, and strategic decision-making. This project aims to build a machine learning-based system to predict product sales using structured data encompassing product specifications and outlet characteristics.

The dataset includes features such as item weight, visibility, MRP, fat content, outlet size, outlet type, location type, and product category. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, treating outliers, and applying feature scaling techniques. Multiple regression algorithms, including Random Forest and XGBoost, were employed, with model performance evaluated using metrics like R-squared, MAE, and RMSE. Features like item MRP, outlet type, and product category showed a strong influence on sales outcomes.

To enhance accessibility and usability, the model was deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input relevant product and outlet details through a graphical interface and receive real-time sales predictions.

This project highlights the practical application of machine learning in retail operations, enabling businesses to make data-driven forecasts that can lead to optimized resource allocation and increased profitability.
